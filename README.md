# FilmsCatalogAPI
FilmsCatalogAPI is really simple project, which allowed me to deep dive into .NET Core and ASP.NET Core frameworks and learn them with on-hands experience.
Project was build around business of ficional cinema. It allows cinema managers to manage films in playlist and client reservations for those films.
It serves REST API methods (CRUD) for managing database of films and reservations.
Project was build using .Net Core, ASP.NET Core and MongoDB technologies.
There is related project (link below) with front-end website covering this API for easier use.
There will be online demo of this API and mentioned frontend website available soon.
